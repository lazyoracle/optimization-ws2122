# Optimization - Saarland University - Winter 2021/22

Code repository for assignments and projects in the Optimization course at Saarland University in WS 2021/22. This is developed on MATLAB R2021b with a variety of add-ons. Some of the Optimal Control scripts also use [casadi](https://web.casadi.org/) and [ipopt](https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/). The scripts do not aim to reach peak performance tuning but are intended to be a pedagogic tool as part of a hands-on graduate level course on Mathematical Optimization as applied to Optimal Control.
